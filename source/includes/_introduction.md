# Introduction

Welcome to the Atlas documentation! Our components were designed to provide to our partners a more streamlined access the Zalando shopping platform to enable our customers to purchase wherever they are. In these pages you'll find all the necessary information to interact with said components.

For the API specifications don't forget to check the Swagger spec for each component. The information here is complimentary to those specs.

We have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
