Atlas Docs
------------

Repository for the documentation of our components.

Information displayed here is directed at clients of team Atlas' components.

Documentation is written with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate)

Getting Started with Slate
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

(Taken, and slightly altered, from Slate's instructions)

1. `cd checkoutapi-docs`
2. Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally

## build
bundle update
bundle install

## run
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Docker).
